In this work we study a popular algorithm, direct preference optimization (DPO), and the mechanisms by which it reduces toxicity. Namely, we first study how toxicity is represented and elicited in a pre-trained language model, GPT2-medium. We then apply DPO with a carefully crafted pairwise dataset to reduce toxicity. We examine how the resulting model averts toxic outputs, and find that capabilities learned from pre-training are not removed, but rather bypassed. We use this insight to demonstrate a simple method to un-align the model, reverting it back to its toxic behavior. ",

For instance, various concepts such as world models, truthfulness, or even taskspecific features have highly interpretable and controllable representations (Li et al., 2023b; Todd et al., 2023; Nanda et al., 2023). Motivated by such findings, we study how the representation space of language models change by comparing it before and after an alignment algorithm is applied. Our work relates to that of Jain et al. (2023), which studies how the capabilities of a language model changes after finetuning on synthetic tasks. Unlike this previous work, we study the change in mechanisms from a RLHF algorithm on a natural language setting. ",

While these capabilities lead to impressive achievements, they also include unwanted behaviors that can be found in large-scale web data, such as toxicity and bias (Sheng et al., 2019; Gehman et al., 2020). As a result, researchers have developed alignment algorithms to reduce undesirable behaviors, which often use reinforcement learning with human preferences (RLHF). For instance, proximal policy optimization (PPO, Schulman et al. 2017) fits a reward model on human preference data, which is then used to fine-tune a language model, while direct preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) by-passes the reward model and derives reward signals directly from pairwise preference data.

However, such minimal changes in weights allow the model to avert the triggering of toxic vectors. Put differently, DPO does not remove the capability of generating toxic outputs, but learns an “offset”, distributed amongst its layers, to “bypass” the regions that elicit toxicity. Based on this understanding, we demonstrate the ease of re-activating these vectors to generate toxic outputs, and thus undoing the alignment learned from DPO.

This can be explained by two facts: first, neurons in MLP blocks of language models are sparse (Zhang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023c), meaning most neurons do not activate during a forward pass. Second, the choice of the MLP’s activation function $\\sigma$ plays a role. Namely, our language model uses GeLU functions (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016). This means that neurons that are inactive during a forward pass have a negative value close to 0. Thus, during the forward pass, for each value vector, the newly learned direction $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { M L P . } \\mathbf { v } }$ gets multiplied by a very small negative scale, flips directions, and contributes towards the $\\delta _ { \\mathbf { x } }$ direction. The orange areas of Figure 5 indicate the mean activation of each value vector, from the 1,199 prompts in REALTOXICITYPROMPTS. Most of the time, value vectors have a negative activation - thus the shift in value vectors end up contributing towards the $\\delta _ { \\mathbf { x } }$ direction. ",

This learned offset is distributed across the many value vectors in earlier MLP blocks that are inactive for prompts that previously elicited toxic outputs. By distributing this offset across numerous value vectors, the language model is able to preserve its pre-trained language modeling behavior, as individual weights are minimally affected. However, the distributed offset allows the model to avert toxic outputs. Note that this behavior matches precisely what the alignment objective was - to preserve as much of the pre-trained behavior, while optimizing for a reward (non-toxic outputs). ",
