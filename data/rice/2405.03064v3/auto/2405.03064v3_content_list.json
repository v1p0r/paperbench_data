However, obtaining an optimally performing DRL agent for complex tasks, especially with sparse rewards, remains a significant challenge. The training of a DRL agent can be often trapped in a bottleneck without further progress. In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative refining scheme for reinforcement learning that incorporates explanation methods to break through the training bottlenecks. The high-level idea of RICE is to construct a new initial state distribution that combines both the default initial states and critical states identified through explanation methods, thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial states. Through careful design, we can theoretically guarantee that our refining scheme has a tighter sub-optimality bound. We evaluate RICE in various popular RL environments and real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RICE significantly outperforms existing refining schemes in enhancing agent performance. ",

To refine the locally optimal DRL agent, one method is to analyze its behavior and patch the errors it made. A recent work (Cheng et al., 2023) proposes StateMask to identify critical states of the agent using an explanation method. One utility of StateMask is patching the agent’s error, which fine-tunes the DRL agent starting from the identified critical states (denoted as “StateMask-R”). However, such an approach suffers from two drawbacks. On the one hand, initializing solely from critical states will hurt the diversity of initial states, which can cause overfitting (see Appendix D). On the other hand, fine-tuning alone cannot help the DRL agent jump out of the local optima. These observations drive us to rethink how to design a proper initial distribution and apply exploration-based techniques to patch previous errors. ",

        "text": "Another reason behind the training bottleneck can be the poor choice of the training algorithm. Naturally, to improve performance, the developer needs to select another DRL training algorithm to re-train the DRL agent. However, for complex DRL tasks, re-training the agent from scratch is too costly. For instance, for AlphaStar (Vinyals et al., 2019) to attain grandmaster-level proficiency in StarCraft, its training period exceeds one month with TPUs. Retraining an agent of this level can incur a cost amounting to millions of dollars (Agarwal et al., 2022). Therefore, existing research has investigated the reuse of previous DRL training (as prior knowledge) to facilitate re-training (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Fu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2022). The most recent example is Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning (JSRL) proposed by Uchendu et al. (2023) which leverages a pre-trained policy to design a curriculum to guide the training of a selfimproving exploration policy. However, their selection of exploration frontiers in the curriculum is random, which cannot guarantee that the exploration frontiers have positive returns. This motivates us to incorporate explanation methods to scrutinize the pre-trained policy and design more effective exploration frontiers. ",

The explanation method identifies the most critical states (i.e., steps that contribute the most to the final reward of a trajectory), which will be used to construct the exploration frontiers. Based on the explanation results, we construct a mixed initial state distribution that combines the default initial states and the identified critical states to prevent the overfitting problem. By forcing the agent to revisit these exploration frontiers, we further incentivize the agent to explore starting from the frontiers. Through exploration, the agent is able to expand state coverage, and therefore more effectively break through the bottlenecks of reinforcement learning training. Our theoretical analysis shows that this method achieves a tighter sub-optimality bound by utilizing this mixed initial distribution (see Section 3.4). ",

        "text": "Recently, there has been some work that leverages the DRL explanation to improve the agent’s performance. These explanations can be derived from either human feedback or automated processes. Guan et al. (2021); Van Waveren et al. (2022) propose to utilize human feedback to correct the agent’s failures. More specifically, when the agent fails, humans (can be non-experts) are involved to point out how to avoid such a failure (i.e., what action should be done instead, and what action should be forbidden). Based on human feedback, the DRL agent gets refined by taking human-advised action in those important time steps and finally obtains the corrected policy. The downside is that it relies on humans to identify critical steps and craft rules for alternative actions. This can be challenging for a large action space, and the retraining process is ad-hoc and time-consuming. Cheng et al. (2023); Yu et al. (2023) propose to use step-level DRL explanation methods to automatically identify critical time steps and refine the agent accordingly. It initiates the refining process by resetting the environment to the critical states and subsequently resumes training the DRL agents from these critical states. Empirically, we observe that this refining strategy can easily lead to overfitting (see Appendix D). Instead, we propose a novel refining strategy with theoretical guarantees to improve the agent’s performance. ",

Some studies propose to “roll-in” with an existing policy for better exploration, as demonstrated in works (Agarwal et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). Similar to our approach, JSRL (Uchendu et al., 2023) incorporates a guide policy for roll-in, followed by a self-improving exploration policy. Technically, JSRL relies on a curriculum for the gradual update of the exploration frontier. However, the curriculum may not be able to truly reflect the key reasons why the guide policy succeeds or fails. Therefore, we propose to leverage the explanation method to automatically identify crucial states, facilitating the rollout of the policy by integrating these identified states with the default initial states. In Section 4, we empirically demonstrate that JSRL performs poorly in our selected games. Chang et al. (2023) propose $\\mathrm { P P O + + }$ that reset the environment to a mixture of the default initial states and the visited states of a guide policy (i.e., a pre-trained policy). It can be viewed as a special case in our framework, i.e., constructing a mixed initial distribution with a random explanation. However, we claim that not all visited states of a pre-trained policy are informative and our theoretical analysis and experiments both show that RICE based on our explanation method outperforms the refining method based on a random explanation.

At a high level, the RICE algorithm integrates a roll-in step, where the RL agent is reset to specific visited states, followed by an exploration step initiated from these chosen states. During the roll-in step, we draw inspiration from established RL-explanation methods (Puri et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2023) to identify critical states, referred to as exploration frontiers, within the given policy $\\pi$ . As depicted in Figure 1, when presented with a trajectory sampled from the policy $\\pi$ , we employ a step-level explanation method – StateMask (Cheng et al., 2023) to identify the most crucial time steps influencing the final rewards in this trajectory. Subsequently, we guide the RL agent to revisit these selected states. The rationale behind revisiting these states lies in their ability to offer an expanded initial state distribution compared to $\\rho$ thereby enabling the agent to explore diverse and relevant states it might otherwise neglect. Additionally, we introduce a mixing of these selected states with the initial states sampled from $\\rho$ . This mixing approach serves the purpose of preventing the agent from overfitting to specific states. In Section 3.4, we theoretically show that RICE achieves a tighter regret bound through the utilization of this mixed initial distribution. ",

Through exploration, we aim to expand state coverage by rewarding the agent for visiting novel states, thereby increasing the likelihood of successfully completing the task.

This neural network takes the current state as input and then outputs this step’s importance score with respect to the agent’s final reward. To do so, StateMask learns a policy to “blind” the target agent at certain steps without changing the agent’s final reward. Specifically, for an input state $s _ { t }$ , the mask net outputs a binary action $a _ { t } ^ { m }$ of either “zero” or “one”, and the target agent will sample the action $a _ { t }$ from its policy.

In contrast to goal-conditional RL (Ren et al., 2019; Ecoffet et al., 2019), which typically involve random exploration from identified frontiers, we advocate for the RL agent to explore novel states to increase the state coverage. Motivated by this, we adopt Random Network Distillation (RND) (Burda et al., 2018) which is proved to be an effective exploration bonus, especially in large and continuous state spaces where count-based bonuses (Bellemare et al., 2016; Ostrovski et al., 2017) can be hard to extend. Specifically, we directly utilize the PPO algorithm to update the policy $\\pi$ , except that we add the intrinsic reward to the task reward, that is, we optimize $R ^ { \\prime } ( s _ { t } , a _ { t } ) = R ( s _ { t } , a _ { t } ) + \\lambda | f ( s _ { t + 1 } ) - \\hat { f } ( s _ { t + 1 } ) | ^ { 2 }$ , where $\\lambda$ controls the trade-off between the task reward and exploration bonus. Along with the policy parameters, the RND predictor network $\\breve { \\hat { f } }$ is updated to regress to the target network $f$ . Note that, as the state coverage increases, RND bonuses decay to zero and a performed policy is recovered. We present our proposed refining method in Algorithm 2. ",

The reason is that the training algorithm of the mask network in StateMask involves an estimation of the discounted accumulated reward with respect to the current policy of the perturbed agent and the policy of the target agent which requires additional computation cost.

However, in Cage Challenge 2, the reward is designed to incorporate negative values (see Appendix C.2). We have three main observations. First, we observe that our refining method can bring the largest improvement for the target agent in all applications. Second, we find that the PPO fine-tuning method only has marginal improvements for the agents due to its incapability of jumping out of local optima. Third, the refining method proposed in StateMask (which is to start fine-tuning only from critical steps) cannot always improve the agent’s performance. The reason is that this refining strategy can cause overfitting and thus harm the agent’s performance. We illustrate this problem in greater detail in a case study of Malware Mutation in Appendix D.

In fact, most of today’s DRL applications rely on some form of simulator for their training. For example, for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, DRL agents are usually designed, trained, and tested in a simulated environment first before moving them to real-world testing. Simulation platforms broadly include Carla (Dosovitskiy et al., 2017) and MetaDrive (Li et al., 2022) which have been used to facilitate the training of DRL agents (Zhang et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2022). Therefore, RICE should be applicable to such DRL systems (especially during their development phase) for refining a pre-trained DRL agent. ",

Even if the agent has good coverage of the state distribution, it does not necessarily mean that the agent has already learned a good policy due to the potential of choosing wrong actions (Uchendu et al., 2023). Therefore, the training bottleneck can still exist under a good coverage of the state distribution. In contrast, Our method does not work well in a “cold start” setting, i.e., when the state coverage of the pre-trained policy is extremely poor. In that case, step-level explanation methods cannot give useful help and our method is actually equivalent to the RND method 3. ",

Though RICE identifies critical states based on their necessity for achieving good outcomes, it does not fully consider their importance for further agent learning. For instance, a state might be deemed critical, yet the trained agent could have already converged to the optimal action for that state. In such cases, resetting the environment to this state doesn’t significantly benefit the learning process. Future work could explore additional filtering of critical states using metrics such as policy convergence or temporal difference (TD) errors, which may help concentrate efforts and accelerate refinement.

The expected total reward of a policy $\\pi$ can be represented as $\\eta ( \\pi ) = <$ $d _ { \\rho } ^ { \\pi } ( \\mathbf { s } ) , R ( \\mathbf { s } ) >$ (Eysenbach et al., 2021), where $R ( \\mathbf { s } ) = [ R ( s _ { A } ) , R ( s _ { B } ) ]$ . Figure 4 shows the area of achievable state distribution via the initial state distribution $\\rho$ (highlighted in orange). ",

However, for any convex combination of valid state occupancy measures, there exists a Markovian policy that has this state occupancy measure. As such, the policy search occurs within a convex polytope, essentially a segment (i.e., , marked in orange) along this line. In Figure 4, we visualize $R ( \\mathbf { s } )$ as vectors starting at the origin. Since $V ^ { \\hat { \\pi } } ( \\rho ) \\geq V ^ { \\pi } ( \\rho )$ , We mark $d _ { \\rho } ^ { \\hat { \\pi } } ( \\mathbf { s } )$ closer to $R ( \\mathbf { s } )$ (i.e., the inner product between $d _ { \\rho } ^ { \\hat { \\pi } } ( \\mathbf { s } )$ and $R ( \\mathbf { s } )$ and is larger than $d _ { \\boldsymbol { \\rho } } ^ { \\pi } ( \\mathbf { s } )$ and $R ( \\mathbf { s } ) \\big > ,$ ).

It’s important to note that our framework is designed to be versatile and is indeed compatible with a goal/state-conditioned policy approach such as Ecoffet et al. (2021). Given a trajectory with an identified most important state, we can select the most important state as the final goal and select the en-route intermediate states as sub-goals. Then we can train an agent to reach the final goal by augmenting each state with the next goal and giving a goal-conditioned reward once the next goal is reached until all goals are achieved. ",

While self-imitation learning has the advantage of encouraging the agent to imitate past successful experiences by prioritizing them in the replay buffer, it cannot address scenarios where the agent (and its past experience) has errors or sub-optimal actions. In contrast, RICE constructs a mixed initial distribution based on the identified critical states (using explanation methods) and encourages the agent to explore the new initial states. This helps the agent escape from local minima and break through the training bottlenecks. ",

Given the undesired outcome, we use our method to identify the critical steps that contribute to the final (undesired) outcome. The important steps are highlighted in red color. Our method identifies the important step as the one when the green car switches across two lanes into the lane of the pink car. The critical state is reasonable because this early step allows the green car to switch lanes to avoid the collision. Based on the provided explanation, we apply our refining method to improve the target agent. The trajectory after refining is shown in Figure 14(b).

Firstly, the reward mechanism is inherently non-Markovian which deviates from the expectation of a typical reinforcement learning (RL) framework. In typical RL settings, rewards are contingent on the current state $s$ and the next state $s ^ { \\prime }$ . However, the current design computes the reward based on the initial state $s _ { 0 }$ and the subsequent state $s ^ { \\prime }$ . Consequently, this may assign an identical reward for the same action (e.g., “upx pack”) in consecutive steps. This non-Markovian nature of the reward mechanism can mislead the DRL agent and hurt its performance. ",

Based on these insights, we fix the bugs in the reward design with two simple steps: (1) We make the reward function Markovian, which depends only on the current state and the next state. (2) We perform scaling on the intermediate reward with a coefficient of 3. After that, we re-run an experiment to evaluate the correctness of our modifications. We train a DRL agent for 100 epochs with the same parameters under the new reward design and test its performance over 3 trials of 500 runs. The experiment shows that the evasion probability of the agent under the new reward design jumps from $4 2 . 2 \\%$ (using the old reward function, see Table 1) to $7 2 . 0 \\%$ , which further confirms our intuitions. This case study illustrates how developers can use RICE to debug their system and improve their designs. ",

In this “extreme” case, Assumption 3.2 is completely broken since the state coverage of the pre-trained agent is limited to a small range around the initial point. In this experiment, we train a target agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for 1 million steps. The results show that the policy performance remained poor, with the agent frequently getting trapped at the starting point of the environment. In such cases where the original policy fails to learn an effective strategy, the role of explanations becomes highly limited. Since RICE relies on the identified critical states to enhance the policy, if the policy itself is extremely weak (i.e., not satisfying Assumption 3.2), then the explanations will not be meaningful, which further huts the refinement. In the case of the Mountain Car experiment, RICE essentially reduces to being equivalent to Random Network Distillation (RND) due to the lack of meaningful explanation. We show the result when refining the pre-trained agent using our method and RND in Figure 15. ",
