We examine difficulties in minimizing the PINN loss function, particularly due to illconditioning caused by differential operators in the residual term. We compare gradient-based optimizers Adam, L-BFGS, and their combination Adam $+ \\mathrm { L }$ -BFGS, showing the superiority of Adam $+ \\mathrm { L }$ -BFGS, and introduce a novel secondorder optimizer, NysNewton-CG (NNCG), which significantly improves PINN performance. Theoretically, our work elucidates the connection between ill-conditioned differential operators and ill-conditioning in the PINN loss and shows the benefits of combining first- and second-order optimization methods. Our work presents valuable insights and more powerful optimization strategies for training PINNs, which could improve the utility of PINNs for solving difficult partial differential equations. ",

        "text": "The study of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) grounds a wide variety of scientific and engineering fields, yet these fundamental physical equations are often difficult to solve numerically. Recently, neural network-based approaches including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise to solve both forward and inverse problems involving PDEs (Raissi et al., 2019; E & Yu, 2018; Lu et al., 2021a;b; Karniadakis et al., 2021; Cuomo et al., 2022). PINNs parameterize the solution to a PDE with a neural network, and are often fit by minimizing a least-squares loss involving the PDE residual, boundary condition(s), and initial condition(s). The promise of PINNs is the potential to obtain solutions to PDEs without discretizing or meshing the space, enabling scalable solutions to high-dimensional problems that currently require weeks on advanced supercomputers. This loss is typically minimized with gradient-based optimizers such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), L-BFGS (Liu & Nocedal, 1989), or a combination of both. ",

As a result, the PINN often fails to learn the solution. Furthermore, optimization challenges can obscure the effectiveness of new neural network architectures for PINNs, as an apparently inferior performance may stem from insufficient loss function optimization rather than inherent limitations of an architecture. A simple, reliable training paradigm is critical to enable wider adoption of PINNs. ",

We show that Adam $+ \\mathrm { L }$ -BFGS is superior across a variety of network sizes (Section 6).   \n• We show the PINN solution resembles the true PDE solution only for extremely small loss values (Section 4). However, we find that the loss returned by Adam+LBFGS can be improved further, which also improves the PINN solution (Section 7).   \n• Motivated by the ill-conditioned loss landscape, we introduce a novel second-order optimizer, NysNewtonCG (NNCG). We show NNCG can significantly improve the solution returned by Adam+L-BFGS (Figure 1 and Section 7).   \n• We prove that ill-conditioned differential operators lead to an ill-conditioned PINN loss (Section 8).

The condition number is defined as the ratio of the largest magnitude’s eigenvalue to the smallest magnitude’s eigenvalue. A large condition number implies the loss is very steep in some directions and flat in others, making it difficult for first-order methods to make sufficient progress toward the minimum. When $H _ { L } ( w )$ has a large condition number (particularly, for $w$ near the optimum), the loss $L$ is called ill-conditioned. For example, the convergence rate of gradient descent (GD) depends on the condition number (Nesterov, 2018), which results in GD converging slowly on ill-conditioned problems. ",

A classic example is Newton’s method, which uses second-order information (i.e., the Hessian) to (locally) transform an ill-conditioned loss landscape into a well-conditioned one. L-BFGS is a quasi-Newton method that improves conditioning without explicit access to the problem Hessian. To examine the effectiveness of quasi-Newton methods for optimizing $L$ , we compute the spectral density of the Hessian after L-BFGS preconditioning. (For details of this computation and how L-BFGS preconditions, see Appendix C.) Figure 3 shows this preconditioned Hessian spectral density (dashed lines). For all three problems, the magnitude of eigenvalues and the condition number has been reduced by at least $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ . In addition, the preconditioner improves the conditioning of each individual loss component of $L$ (Figures 3 and 7). These observations offer clear evidence that quasi-Newton methods improve the conditioning of the loss, and show the importance of quasi-Newton methods in training PINNs, which we demonstrate in Section 6.

(2023)’s analysis is based on the lazy training regime, which assumes the NTK is approximately constant. This regime does not accurately capture the behavior of practical neural networks (Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019; Chizat et al., 2019; Ghorbani et al., 2020; 2021). Moreover, gradient descent can converge even with a non-constant NTK (Liu et al., 2020).

If the spectrum of $\\mathcal { A } \\circ \\mathcal { K } _ { \\infty } ( w _ { \\star } )$ decays polynomially, then, with high probability, the condition number grows with $n _ { \\mathrm { r e s } }$ . As $n _ { \\mathrm { r e s } }$ typically ranges from $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ , Theorem 8.4 shows the condition number of the PINN problem is generally large, and so first-order methods will be slow to converge to the optimum. Figure 10 in Appendix F.5 empirically verifies the claim of Theorem 8.4 for the convection equation. ",

Consequently, L-BFGS can take a step that makes more progress than a method like gradient descent, which performs no preconditioning at all. In the second phase, L-BFGS maps the progress in the preconditioned space back to the original space. Thus, L-BFGS is able to make superior progress by transforming (2) to another space where the conditioning is more favorable, which enables it to compute an update that better reduces the loss in (2).
