However, simply updating the model with the corrected error instances causes catastrophic forgetting—the updated model makes errors on instances learned during the instruction tuning or upstream training phase. Randomly replaying upstream data yields unsatisfactory performance and often comes with high variance and poor controllability. To this end, we try to forecast upstream examples that will be forgotten due to a model update for improved controllability of the replay process and interpretability. We train forecasting models given a collection of online learned examples and corresponding forgotten upstream pre-training examples. We propose a partially interpretable forecasting model based on the observation that changes in pre-softmax logit scores of pretraining examples resemble that of online learned examples, which performs decently on BART but fails on T5 models. We further show a black-box classifier based on inner products of example representations achieves better forecasting performance over a series of setups. Finally, we show that we reduce forgetting of upstream pretraining examples by replaying examples that are forecasted to be forgotten, demonstrating the practical utility of forecasting example forgetting.

Although a few steps of parameter updates are usually sufficient to correct errors (De Cao et al., 2021), a main obstacle is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., massive misprediction of previously learned examples (Robins, 1995). To combat forgetting, a prevalent practice in model refinement or continual learning algorithms is to replay previously learned examples, most of which rely on random sampling from upstream training data (de Masson D’Autume et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2022). However, such practice has shortcomings that (1) they lack interpretability on what previously learned examples are affected due to model updates, and (2) they achieve inferior performance as the replayed examples are not properly targeted.

For PTLMs, such interaction is intriguing to humans, as exemplified in Figure 1, where learning an example about public relations causes forgetting of an example in paraphrase detection.

With empirical study, we demonstrate the phenomenon of “logit-change transfer”, i.e., the changes in pre-softmax logits of upstream pretraining examples proportionally copy that of online learned examples while fixing an error, causing forgetting of the upstream pretraining example. Motivated by this finding, we build a partially interpretable forecasting model that learns how much logit changes are transferred based on the similarity of two examples.

We figure out clues by examining logit change (pre-softmax outputs) of two examples after model updates. Figure 2(a) reveals that in the same pair of examples, the logit scores of the some tokens such as “not” and “duplicates” in $\\left. x _ { i } , y _ { i } \\right.$ changes significantly, despite that their token probabilities after normalization are close to 0. This logit change does not have an effect on the prediction of $\\left. x _ { i } , y _ { i } \\right.$ ; but the problem arises on $\\langle x _ { j } , y _ { j } \\rangle$ as the logit change partially transfers to the example. In the pretraining example $\\langle x _ { j } , y _ { j } \\rangle$ , the logit change affects the ordering of the top-2 prediction candidates (“not” versus “duplicates”), causing the prediction to flip.

A natural question is whether we can predict the proportion of logit changes of $\\left. x _ { i } , y _ { i } \\right.$ that will be transferred to $\\langle x _ { j } , y _ { j } \\rangle$ . We derive the relationships between logit change of the online learned example and the pretraining example with techniques similar to previous work on neural tangent kernels (NTKs) (Lee et al., 2019). We note the output logits of an example $x$ as $\\hat { f } ( x ) \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { T V }$ , where $T$ is the output length, and $V$ is the size of the vocabulary. The change of model parameters $\\Delta \\theta _ { i } = \\theta _ { i } - \\theta _ { 0 }$ in the model $f$ after a single step of gradient step on the online learning example $\\left. x _ { i } , y _ { i } \\right.$ is $\\theta _ { i } - \\theta _ { 0 } = - \\eta \\nabla _ { \\theta } \\hat { f } _ { 0 } ( x _ { i } ) \\nabla _ { \\hat { f } _ { 0 } ( x _ { i } ) } \\mathcal { L } ( x _ { i } , y _ { i } )$ , where $\\mathcal { L }$ is the training loss function and $\\eta$ is the learning rate. With the first-order Taylor expansion, the logit change of another example, the upstream example $x _ { j }$ , can be approximated as $\\Delta \\hat { f } _ { i } ( x _ { j } ) = \\hat { f } _ { i } ( x _ { j } ) - \\hat { f } _ { 0 } ( x _ { j } ) = - \\eta \\Theta ( x _ { j } , x _ { i } ) \\mathcal { L } ( x _ { i } , y _ { i } )$ where the kernel $\\Theta ( x _ { j } , x _ { i } ) \\ \\in \\ \\mathbb { R } ^ { T V \\times T V }$ measures inner products among gradients $\\nabla _ { \\boldsymbol { \\theta } } \\hat { f } _ { 0 } ( x _ { j } ) \\nabla _ { \\boldsymbol { \\theta } } \\hat { f } _ { 0 } ( x _ { i } ) ^ { T }$ . Similarly, for the online learning example, the logit change is $\\Delta \\bar { f _ { i } } ( x _ { i } ) = \\hat { f _ { i } } ( x _ { i } ) - \\hat { f _ { 0 } } ( x _ { i } ) \\bar { { \\bf \\Phi } } = - \\eta \\bar { \\Theta } ( x _ { i } , x _ { i } ) \\bar { \\mathcal { L } } ( x _ { i } , y _ { i } )$ . We therefore obtain the relationship between the logit changes of $x _ { i }$ and $x _ { j }$ , ",

Logit-based forecasting is more efficient than computing ground truth when the maximal sequence length $T$ is small due to the term $T ^ { 2 }$ in its computational complexity. Nevertheless, all forecasting methods are far more efficient than computing the ground truth when the entire LM is fine-tuned because no repetitive inference with the LM is required. Although strategies such as retrieving examples from a smaller subset can reduce the number of forward passes (as in MIR), it also clearly reduces performance benefits as we discussed in Sec. 5.2.

Future work can analyze factors that affect the success of the approach and develop forecasting methods with similar level of interpretability but improved performance. Besides, although we showed that forecasting models generalizes from fixing single errors to multiple errors, future works can update forecasting models alongside the language model for better performance in continual model refinement. A topic that we did not touch on comprehensively in this paper is how distributional relationships between upstream and online examples (e.g., task similarity) affects forgetting. We expect analyzing the associations to be an interesting future work. ",

Table 9 shows that using a larger rate $( 1 e ^ { - 4 } )$ than our default setup $( 1 e ^ { - 5 } )$ clearly increases EM Drop ratio; while using a smaller learning rate $( 2 e ^ { - 6 } )$ reduces EM Drop ratio at a cost of edit success rate. We further evaluate the forecasting model trained in the default setup on other learning rate setups and present the results in Figure 4. We notice that the precision scores almost remain the same across different learning rates, as a common subset of examples are forgotten; while recall scores differ across setups, because a greater number of examples are forgotten only when using larger learning rates. The results imply the precision scores of forecasting methods generalize well across different learning rate setups. ",

This corresponds to replaying 3 mini-batches over 30 steps of model updates on a single online learning example. We also present the result of increasing the number of replayed examples by reducing intervals between replays while learning an online learning example. Table 10 summarizes the results. When fixing single errors, we notice that increasing the number of replayed examples causes increased forgetting (EM Drop Ratio). This is not surprising given previous studies that show overfitting of models to replayed examples (Buzzega et al., 2020b; Jin et al., 2022). Meanwhile, increasing the number of replayed examples consistently reduces the EM drop ratio when continually fixing multiple errors. By comparing to the results in Table 3, we see that the EM Drop Ratio of replaying 3 mini-batches of examples forecasted to be forgotten is between that of replaying 6 to 15 minibatches of random examples.
