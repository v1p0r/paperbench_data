Prior work has shown that these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the vision modality. These attacks can be leveraged to spread fake information or defraud users, and thus pose a significant risk, which makes the robustness of large multi-modal foundation models a pressing problem. The CLIP model, or one of its variants, is used as a frozen vision encoder in many large vision-language models (LVLMs), e.g. LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder, which yields robustness on all vision down-stream tasks (LVLMs, zero-shot classification) that rely on CLIP. In particular, we show that stealth-attacks on users of LVLMs by a malicious third party providing manipulated images are no longer possible once one replaces the original CLIP model with our robust one. No retraining or fine-tuning of the down-stream LVLMs is required. The code and robust models are available on GitHub. ",

The most relevant example is CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), which learns, via contrastive training, to encode text and images into a feature space where inputs, in either form, capturing similar concepts are mapped to be close to each other. These models show great promise for many down-stream tasks, in particular thanks to their very good performance in zero-shot settings: for example, they can encode virtually any class via its textual description, which makes them well-suited for zero-shot image classification. Additionally, CLIP-like models are an essential component of recent large vision language models (LVLMs): in fact, OpenFlamingo (Awadalla et al., 2023) and LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023b;a) are built connecting the frozen vision encoder of the original CLIP with a large language model (MPT (MosaicML, 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) respectively). These LVLMs exhibit excellent zero-shot generalization capabilities, e.g. in image captioning, visual question answering (VQA) and classification from text prompts. ",

This likely large-scale deployment raises questions on the safety and alignment of these systems, and how to prevent the abuse of their abilities and weaknesses by malicious actors. Therefore it becomes extremely important to test and improve the robustness of these models. Recent works (Zhao et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023) have shown that LVLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on either text or image inputs. In particular, the vision modality is argued to be the easier one to fool (Carlini et al., 2023): even commercial LVLMs like BARD could be attacked successfully with large perturbations (Dong et al., 2023). Moreover, Schlarmann & Hein (2023) show that imperceptible changes of an image can be used for targeted attacks on LVLMs. This allows malicious third parties to spread such images on the web for defrauding users or spreading misinformation on a massive scale.

In this way, simultaneously two objectives are achieved: (i) we can readily replace the original CLIP with our robust CLIP in all down-stream tasks without retraining or fine-tuning since the features on clean inputs are (approximately) preserved.

This does not take into account the effect on other text embeddings, e.g. of categories which are not part of ImageNet, and thus the fine-tuning can lead to heavy distortions with respect to unseen classes, which explains the high losses in standard performance for other down-stream zero-shot classification tasks, see Table 4. Second, the loss uses the cosine similarity, which effectively means that it only cares about the projection of the embedding on the hypersphere: one could multiply each $\\phi ( x )$ by a different scalar factor $\\alpha ( x )$ and the cosine similarity would be unaffected. Thus during finetuning it can happen that the embedding is changed along the radial direction in an arbitrary fashion. As other downstream tasks of CLIP, e.g. LVLMs (Alayrac et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023a), use the unnormalized embedding this can again lead to huge performance losses. While for the first problem there is no easy solution, the second problem could be solved by retraining the part of the LVLM that connects the vision and language components. However, our approach solves both problems at the same time, so that we can get the benefits of our robust CLIP model and maintain good clean performance on all down-stream tasks without the need of fine-tuning or retraining.

In order to control the trade-off, we use $\\varepsilon = { ^ 4 } / { _ { 2 5 5 } }$ and $\\varepsilon = { ^ 2 } / { _ { 2 5 5 } }$ for fine-tuning and denote the CLIP-models as $\\mathrm { F A R E ^ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { F A R E } ^ { 2 }$ (resp. $\\mathrm { T e C o A ^ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { T e C o A } ^ { 2 }$ ). The larger radius is standard for ImageNet. We observe that the smaller radius is sufficient to get non-trivial robustness even when testing at $^ { 4 / 2 5 5 }$ while maintaining a clean performance close to the the original CLIP model. However, only the models trained for $\\varepsilon = { ^ 4 } / { _ { 2 5 5 } }$ are fully robust against targeted imperceptible attacks on LVLMs, see Table 3 and Fig. 3. ",

After each attack, we do not attack samples whose score is already below a threshold anymore. In the final step we employ a similar attack at single precision. For the VQA tasks we additionally employ targeted attacks at single precision. The higher precision yields a stronger but more expensive attack. By first eliminating easy-to-break samples, the proposed pipeline ensures that the expensive attack is applied only when necessary, thereby saving runtime.

To evaluate the adversarial robustness of the models, we employ the first two attacks of AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020), namely APGD with crossentropy and APGD with DLR loss (100 iterations each). Note that we use the targeted DLR loss (similar to AutoAttack) in contrast to Mao et al. (2023), where the weaker untargeted version is used. ",

Importantly, this procedure does not require any retraining of the down-stream LVLM, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, our method provides an easy defense against visual adversaries of LVLMs while maintaining high performance on nominal inputs. As most users of machine learning models are not willing to sacrifice nominal performance for gains in robustness, our models are a felicitous choice for practical applications and real-world deployment.

This shows that our hyperparameter selection is not to the disadvantage of TeCoA. Similar to what we have seen in the main paper, FARE is as expected worse on ImageNet where TeCoA has an advantage due to the supervised training, but the unsupervised training of FARE allows it to generalize better to other classification tasks, with clean performance close to that of the original CLIP model, at the price of slightly lower robustness than TeCoA.

For the captioning tasks COCO and Flickr30k there are five ground truth captions available for each image and each is considered for computation of the CIDEr score (Vedantam et al., 2015). We conduct APGD attacks at half precision with 100 iterations against each ground-truth. After each attack we compute the CIDEr scores and do not attack the samples anymore that already have a score below 10 or 2 for COCO and Flickr30k respectively. These thresholds correspond to less than $10 \\%$ of the original LLaVA performance. Applying them allows us to invest more computational budget in samples that still have a high score, yielding a more efficient attack. In the final step we employ a similar attack at single precision, using the ground-truth that led to the lowest score and initialize it with the according perturbation. For the VQA tasks we use a similar scheme, however the score-threshold is set to 0 and we use the five most frequent ground-truths among the ten available ones. Additionally, we employ targeted attacks at single precision with target strings “Maybe” and “Word”. For TextVQA it was observed that the second targeted attack is not necessary, thus we apply only the first one. Following Schlarmann & Hein (2023), we set the initial step-size of APGD to $\\varepsilon$ . ",
