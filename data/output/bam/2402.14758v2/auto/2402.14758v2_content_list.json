But such approaches to BBVI often converge slowly due to the high variance of their gradient estimates and their sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we propose batch and match (BaM), an alternative approach to BBVI based on a score-based divergence. Notably, this score-based divergence can be optimized by a closed-form proximal update for Gaussian variational families with full covariance matrices. We analyze the convergence of BaM when the target distribution is Gaussian, and we prove that in the limit of infinite batch size the variational parameter updates converge exponentially quickly to the target mean and covariance. We also evaluate the performance of BaM on Gaussian and non-Gaussian target distributions that arise from posterior inference in hierarchical and deep generative models. In these experiments, we find that BaM typically converges in fewer (and sometimes significantly fewer) gradient evaluations than leading implementations of BBVI based on ELBO maximization. ",

        "text": "1. Introduction. Probabilistic modeling plays a fundamental role in many problems of inference and decision-making, but it can be challenging to develop accurate probabilistic models that remain computationally tractable. In typical applications, the goal is to estimate a target distribution that cannot be evaluated or sampled from exactly, but where an unnormalized form is available. A canonical situation is applied Bayesian statistics, where the target is a posterior distribution of latent variables given observations, but where only the model’s joint distribution is available in closed form. Variational inference (VI) has emerged as a leading method for fast approximate inference (Blei et al., 2017; Jordan et al., 1999; Wainwright et al., 2008). The idea behind VI is to posit a parameterized family of approximating distributions, and then to find the member of that family which is closest to the target distribution. ",

Most BBVI algorithms work with a factorized (or mean-field) family, and minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). But this approach has its drawbacks. The optimizations can be plagued by high-variance gradients and sensitivity to hyperparameters of the learning algorithms (Dhaka et al., 2020, 2021). These issues are further exacerbated in high-dimensional problems and when using richer variational families that model the correlations between different latent variables. There has been recent work on BBVI which avoids SGD for Gaussian variational families (Modi et al., 2023), but this approach does not minimize an explicit divergence and requires additional heuristics to converge for non-Gaussian targets.

In proximal point methods, the updates are always regularized by squared Euclidean distance, but the KL divergence has been used elsewhere as a regularizer—for example, in the EM algorithm (Chrétien and Hero, 2000; Tseng, 2004) and for approximate Bayesian inference (Dai et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2015, 2016; Theis and Hoffman, 2015). KL-based regularizers are also a hallmark of mirror descent methods (Nemirovskii and Yudin, 1983), but in these methods the objective function is linearized—a poor approximation for objective functions with high curvature.

First, these error bounds behave sensibly: they suggest that the updates converge more slowly when the learning rate is small (with $\\lambda \\ll 1$ ), when the variational mean is poorly initialized (with $\\| \\varepsilon _ { 0 } \\| ^ { 2 } \\gg 1$ ), and/or when the initial estimate of the covariance is nearly singular (with $\\alpha \\ll 1$ ). Second, the theorem holds under very general conditions—not only for any initialization of $\\mu _ { 0 }$ and $\\Sigma _ { 0 } \\succ 0$ , but also for any $\\lambda > 0$ . This robustness is typical of proximal algorithms, which are well-known for their stability with respect to hyperparameters (Asi and Duchi, 2019), but it is uncharacteristic of many gradient-based methods, which only converge when the learning rate varies inversely with the largest eigenvalue of an underlying Hessian (Garrigos and Gower, 2023). Third, with more elaborate bookkeeping, we can derive tighter bounds both for the above setting and also when different iterations use varying levels of regularization $\\{ \\lambda _ { t } \\} _ { t = 0 } ^ { \\infty }$ . We give a full proof with these extensions in Appendix D. ",

GSM is an iterative algorithm for BBVI that updates a full-covariance Gaussian by analytically solving a system of nonlinear equations. As previously discussed, BaM recovers GSM as a special limiting case. A limitation of GSM is that it aims to match the scores exactly; thus, if the target is not exactly Gaussian, the updates for GSM attempt to solve an infeasible problem, In addition, the batch updates for GSM perform an ad hoc averaging that is not guaranteed to match any scores exactly, even when it is possible to do so. BaM overcomes these limitations by optimizing a proper score-based divergence on each batch of samples. Empirically, with BaM, we observe that larger batch sizes lead to more stable convergence. The score-based divergence behind BaM also lends itself to analysis, and we can provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of BaM for Gaussian targets. ",

(2015, 2016) propose a splitting method for this objective, and by linearizing the difficult terms, they obtain a closed-form solution when the variational family is Gaussian and additional knowledge is given about the structure of the target.

        "text": "6. Discussion and future work. In this paper, we introduce a score-based divergence that is especially well-suited to BBVI with Gaussian variational families. We show that the score-based divergence has a number of desirable properties. We then propose a regularized optimization based on this divergence, and we show that it admits a closed-form solution, leading to a fast iterative algorithm for score-based BBVI. We analyze the convergence of score-based BBVI when the target is Gaussian, and in the limit of an infinite batch size, we show that the updates converge exponentially quickly to the target mean and covariance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BaM in a number of empirical studies involving both Gaussian and non-Gaussian targets; here we observe that for sufficiently large batch sizes, our method converges much faster than other BBVI algorithms.

        "text": "There are a number of fruitful directions for future work. First, it remains to analyze the convergence of BaM in the finite-batch case and for a larger class of target distributions. Second, it seems promising to develop score-based BBVI for other (non-Gaussian) variational families, and more generally, to study what divergences lend themselves to stochastic proximal point algorithms. Third, the BaM approach can be modified to utilize data subsampling (potentially with control variates (Wang et al., 2024)) for large-scale Bayesian inference problems, where a noisy estimate of the target density’s score is used in place of its exact score.
