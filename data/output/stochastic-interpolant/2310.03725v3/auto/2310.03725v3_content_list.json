Conventionally, one of these is the target density, only accessible through samples, while the other is taken as a simple base density that is data-agnostic. In this work, using the framework of stochastic interpolants, we formalize how to couple the base and the target densities, whereby samples from the base are computed conditionally given samples from the target in a way that is different from (but does not preclude) incorporating information about class labels or continuous embeddings. This enables us to construct dynamical transport maps that serve as conditional generative models. We show that these transport maps can be learned by solving a simple square loss regression problem analogous to the standard independent setting. We demonstrate the usefulness of constructing dependent couplings in practice through experiments in superresolution and in-painting.

Typically, the base density is taken to be something simple, analytically tractable, and easy to sample, such as a standard Gaussian. In some formulations, such as scorebased diffusion (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2020; Ho et al., 2020b; Song et al., 2020; Singhal et al., 2023), a Gaussian base density is intrinsically tied to the process achieving the transport.

        "text": "Couplings. Several works have studied the question of how to build couplings, primarily from the viewpoint of optimal transport theory. An initial perspective in this regard comes from (Pooladian et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2023; Klein et al., 2023), who state an unbiased means for building entropically-regularized optimal couplings from minibatches of training samples. This perspective is appealing in that it may give probability flows that are straighter and hence more easily computed using simple ODE solvers. However, it relies on estimating an optimal coupling over minibatches of the entire dataset, which, for large datasets, may become uninformative as to the true coupling. In an orthogonal perspective, (Lee et al., 2023) presented an algorithm to learn a coupling between the base and the target by building dependence on the target into the base. They argue that this can reduce curvature of the underlying transport. While this perspective empirically reduces the curvature of the flow lines, it introduces a potential bias in that they still sample from an independent base, possibly not equal to the marginal of the learned conditional base. Learning a coupling can also be achieved by solving the Schrodinger ¨ bridge problem, as investigated e.g. in (De Bortoli et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2023). This leads to iterative algorithms that require solving pairs of SDEs until convergence, which is costly in practice. More closely connected to our work are the approaches proposed in (Liu et al., 2023a; Somnath et al., 2023): by considering generative modeling through the lens of diffusion bridges with known coupling, they arrive to a formulation that is operationally similar to, but less general than, ours. Our approach is simpler, and more flexible, as it differentiates between the bridging of the densities and the construction of the generative models. Table 1 summarizes these couplings along with the standard independent pairing. ",

Generative models built upon dynamical transport of measure go back at least to (Tabak & Vanden-Eijnden, 2010; Tabak & Turner, 2013), and were further developed in (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Dinh et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2016; Durkan et al., 2019) using compositions of discrete maps, while modern models are typically formulated via a continuous-time transformation. In this context, a major advance was the introduction of score-based diffusion (Song et al., 2021b;a), which relates to denoising diffusion probabilistic models (Ho et al., 2020a), and allows one to generate samples by learning to reverse a stochastic differential equation that maps the data into samples from a Gaussian base density.

In-painting diffusions have been applied to video generation (Ho et al., 2022b) and protein backbone generation (Trippe et al., 2022). In the replacement method one directly inputs the clean values of the known coordinates at each step of integration (Ho et al., 2022b); (Schneuing et al., 2022) replace with draws of the diffused state of the known coordinates.

Various works seek to minimize this distance procedurally either by adapting the coupling (Pooladian et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2023) or by optimizing $\\rho _ { t } ( x )$ (Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2022), at additional cost. Here we introduce designed couplings at no extra cost that can lower the upper bound in (15). This will allow us to show how different couplings enable stricter control of the transport cost in various applications. Let us now discuss a generic instantiation of our formalism involving a specific choice of $\\rho ( x _ { 0 } , x _ { 1 } )$ . ",

We set the conditioning variable $\\xi \\in \\{ 0 , 1 \\} ^ { \\cdot _ { C \\times W \\times H } }$ and additionally provide the model with any potential class labels. For simplicity, the mask takes the same value for all channels in a given spatial location in the image. We define the base density by the relation $x _ { 0 } = \\xi \\circ x _ { 1 } + ( 1 - \\xi ) \\circ \\zeta$ , where $\\circ$ denotes the Hadamard (elementwise) product and $\\zeta \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { C \\times W \\times H } , \\zeta \\sim \\mathsf { N } ( 0 , I d )$ denotes random noise used to initialize the pixels within the masked region (separate noise for each channel). During training, the mask is drawn randomly by tiling the image into 64 tiles; each tile is selected to enter the mask with probability $p = 0 . 3$ . In our experiments, we set $\\rho _ { 1 } ( x _ { 1 } )$ to correspond to ImageNet (either 256 or 512). This corresponds to using $\\rho ( x _ { 0 } , x _ { 1 } | \\boldsymbol { \\xi } ) = \\rho _ { 1 } ( x _ { 1 } ) \\rho _ { 0 } ( x _ { 0 } | x _ { 1 } , \\boldsymbol { \\xi } )$ . The model sees the mask; we note that we do not need to additionally input the partial image as extra conditioning because it is present, uncorrupted, in $x _ { t }$ for each $t$ because the values are present in $x _ { 0 }$ and $x _ { 1 }$ . In the interpolant (20), we set $\\alpha _ { t } \\ = \\ t$ and $\\beta _ { t } = 1 - t$ . In this setup, the velocity field $b _ { t } ( x , \\xi )$ is such that $b _ { t } ( x , \\xi ) = 0$ except in the masked regions. This follows because $\\xi \\circ I _ { t } = \\xi \\circ x _ { 1 }$ for every $t$ , i.e., the unmasked pixels in $I _ { t }$ are always those of $x _ { 1 }$ for which $\\dot { I } _ { t } = 0$ . To take this structural information into account, we can build this property into our neural network model, and mask the output of the approximate velocity field to enforce that the unmasked pixels remain fixed. We note that this method does not necessitate any inference time corrections, such as the replacement method or MCMC. ",

We denote by $\\mathcal { D } : \\mathbb { R } ^ { C \\times W \\times H }  \\mathbb { R } ^ { C \\times W _ { \\mathrm { l o w } } \\times H _ { \\mathrm { l o w } } }$ and $\\mathcal { U } : \\mathbb { R } ^ { C \\times W _ { \\mathrm { l o w } } \\times H _ { \\mathrm { l o w } } } \\to \\mathbb { R } ^ { C \\times W \\times H }$ image downsampling and upsampling operations, where $W _ { \\mathrm { l o w } }$ and $H _ { \\mathrm { l o w } }$ denote the width and height of a low-resolution image.

Working with $\\sigma > 0$ alleviates the associated singularities by adding a small amount of Gaussian noise to smooth the base density so it is well-defined over the entire higher-dimensional ambient space. In addition, we give the model access to the lowresolution image at all times; this problem setting then corresponds to using $\\rho ( x _ { 0 } , x _ { 1 } | \\boldsymbol { \\xi } ) = \\rho _ { 1 } ( x _ { 1 } ) \\rho _ { 0 } ( x _ { 0 } | x _ { 1 } , \\boldsymbol { \\xi } )$ with $\\xi = \\mathcal { U } \\left( \\mathcal { D } \\left( x _ { 1 } \\right) \\right)$ .

There are many interesting generative modeling problems that stand to benefit from the incorporation of data-dependent structure. In the sciences, one potential application is in molecule generation, where we can imagine using data-dependent base distributions to fix a chemical backbone and vary functional groups. The dependency and conditioning structure needed to accomplish a task like this is similar to image inpainting. In machine learning, one potential application is in correcting autoencoding errors produced by an architecture such as a variational autoencoder (Kingma & Welling, 2013), where we could take the target density to be inputs to the autoencoder and the base density to be the output of the autoencoder.
