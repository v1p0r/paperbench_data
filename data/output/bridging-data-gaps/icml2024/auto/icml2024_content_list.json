Previous works, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have tackled the limited data problem by transferring pretrained models learned with sufficient data. However, those methods are hard to utilize in DPMs because of the distinct differences between DPM-based and GANbased methods, which show the integral of the unique iterative denoising process and the need for many time steps with no target noise in DPMs. In this paper, we propose a novel DPM-based transfer learning method, called DPMs-ANT, to address the limited data problem. It includes two strategies: similarity-guided training, which boosts transfer with a classifier, and adversarial noise selection, which adaptively chooses targeted noise based on the input image. Extensive experiments in the context of few-shot image generation tasks demonstrate that our method is efficient and excels in terms of image quality and diversity compared to existing GAN-based and DPM-based methods.

Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021), which are designed to replicate data distributions by learning to invert multistep noise procedures, have recently experienced significant advancements, enabling the generation of highdefinition images with broad diversity. Although DPMs have emerged as a potent tool for image generation with remarkable results in terms of both quality and diversity, modern DPMs heavily rely on extensive amounts of data to train the large-scale parameters of their networks (Cao et al., 2022). This dependency can lead to overfitting and a failure to generate diverse and high-quality images with limited training data. Additionally, diffusion sampling with guidance struggles to generate images with a large domain gap. Unfortunately, gathering sufficient data is not always feasible in certain situations. ",

The fundamental idea is to begin training with a source model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset, and then adapt it to a target domain with limited data. Several techniques have been proposed in the past to adapt pre-trained GAN-based models (Wang et al., 2018; Karras et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) from large-scale source datasets to target datasets using a limited number of training samples. Typically, methods for few-shot image generation either enhance the training data artificially using data augmentation to prevent overfitting (Zhang et al., 2018; Karras et al., 2020a), or directly evaluate the distance between the processed image and the target image (Ojha et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022).

        "text": "Nevertheless, applying prior GAN-based techniques to DPMs is challenging due to the differences in training processes between GAN-based and DPM-based methods. GANs can quickly generate a final processed image from latent space, while DPMs only predict less noisy images at each step and request a large number of timesteps to generate a high-quality final image. Such an iterative denoising process poses two challenges when transferring diffusion models. The first challenge is that the transfer direction needs to be estimated on noisy images. The single-pass generation of GANs allows them to directly compare the generated clean images with the target image (Li et al., 2020; Ojha et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022), which is not easily applicable to diffusion models. The current DPM-based few-shot method, DDPM pairwise adaptation (DDPM-PA) (Zhu et al., 2022), substitutes the high quality real final image with the predicted blurred final in the intermediate time step to address this problem. However, comparing the target image with the blurry image can be problematic and inaccurate, as the predicted image may not accurately represent the domain of the generated images. It leads to the production of DDPM-PA final images that are fuzzy and distorted. Moreover, even if the transfer direction can be available, we still face a more fundamental second challenge resulting from the noise mechanism in diffusion models. The diffusion and denoising process utilize fully random Gaussian noise, which is independent of the input image and makes no assumption of it. We observe that such non-targeted noise imposes unbalanced effects on different images, leading to divergent transferring pace in terms of training iteration needed. As demonstrated in Figure 1, while one image (the green box image in the lower row) might be adequately transferred from the source to the target domain, another (the red boxed images in the lower row) may become overly similar to the target image due to severe overfitting. Consequently, an extensive number of iterations are required to transfer and train effectively within the normally distributed noise. This is especially challenging when the gradient direction is noisy due to limited images, leading to overfitting problems. ",

        "text": "In this paper, to handle the challenge of transferring direction estimation for diffusion models, we propose to leverage a similarity measurement to estimate the gap between the source and the target, which circumvents the necessity of comparing individual images. Building upon this, we introduce a similarity-guided training approach to fine-tune the pre-trained source model to the target domain. It employs a classifier to estimate the divergence between the source and target domains, leveraging existing knowledge from the source domain to aid in training the target domain. This method not only helps in bridging the gap between the source and target domains for diffusion models but also addresses the unstable gradient direction caused by limited target data in the few-shot setting by implicitly comparing the sparse target data with the abundant source data. More importantly, to tackle the challenge of non-targeted noise in diffusion models, we propose a novel min-max training process, i.e., adversarial noise selection, to dynamically choose the noise according to the input image. The adversarial noise scheme enhances few-shot transfer learning by minimizing the “worse-case” Gaussian noise which the pre-trained model fails to denoise on the target dataset. This strategy also significantly reduces the training iterations needed and greatly improves the efficiency of transfer learning for diffusion models. Our adversarial strategy with similarity measurement excels in a few-shot image generation tasks, speeding up training, achieving faster convergence, and creating images that fit the target style while resembling the source images. Experiments on few-shot image generation tasks demonstrate that our method surpasses existing GAN-based and DDPM-based techniques, offering superior quality and diversity. ",

DDPMs, by enabling the diffusion reverse process, are capable of reconstructing images. However, DDPM suffers from a long computational time because of extensive iterative time steps. DDIM (Song et al., 2020) addresses this issue by “implicating” the model, which allows it to function with far fewer iterations and dramatically reduces the inference time compared to DDPM. Conversely, a fresh approach to the diffusion model is the score-based model via stochastic differential equation (SDE), wherein the diffusion and the denoising processes are both modeled by SDEs. Song & Ermon (2019) initially proposed the generation of samples from latent noise via the dynamic Langevin sampling method. Variational diffusion models (VDM) (Kingma et al., 2021) introduced an innovative method that merges the capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and diffusion models. This hybrid approach resulted in notable enhancements in the quality and diversity of generated samples. Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models (KDDM) (Huang et al., 2024) developed a strategy that substantially decreases the inference time required by diffusion models, without sacrificing the quality of the outputs. Additionally, Yu et al. (2022); Karras et al. (2022) use higher-order solvers to replace the original reverse process in diffusion models, enabling faster sampling. For fast high-quality and high-resolution image generation, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) (Rombach et al., 2022) gradually transform random noise into the target image through a diffusion process on the latent representation space.

FreezeD (Mo et al., 2020) addresses overfitting by locking parameters in the highresolution layers of the discriminator. MineGAN (Wang et al., 2020) incorporates additional networks to fine-tune the noise inputs of the generator. EWC (Li et al., 2020) uses elastic weight consolidation, making it difficult to modify essential weights that possess high Fisher information values. CDC (Ojha et al., 2021) introduces cross-domain consistency loss and patch-level discrimination to forge a connection between the source and target domains. DCL (Zhao et al., 2022) uses contrastive learning to distance the generated samples from the actual images and maximize the similarity between the corresponding pair of images in the source and target domains. Similar to CDC, DDPM-PA (Zhu et al., 2022) adapts pre-trained diffusion models on extensive source domains to target domains with cross-domain consistency loss and patch-level discrimination. GAN-based methods, like CDC and DCL, require the final generated image during training.

For Intra-LPIPS, we generate 1,000 images, each of which will be assigned to the training sample with the smallest LPIPS distance. The Intra-LPIPS measurement is obtained by averaging the pairwise LPIPS distances within the same cluster and then averaging these results across all clusters. A model that flawlessly duplicates training samples will have an Intra-LPIPS score of zero, which indicates a lack of diversity. However, higher Intra-LPIPS scores imply greater generation diversity, an essential quality for an efficient few-shot image generation technique. This allows for a more robust assessment of our method’s generation quality in comparison to other generative models. FID is a widely used metric for assessing the generation quality of generative models by calculating the distribution distances between generated samples and datasets. However, FID may become unstable and unreliable when applied to datasets with few samples, such as the 10-shot datasets used in this paper. Following DDPM-PA (Zhu et al., 2022), we provide FID evaluations using larger target datasets, such as Sunglasses and Babies, consisting of $^ { 2 , 5 \\mathrm { k } }$ and $2 , 7 \\mathrm { k }$ and images, respectively.

This illustrates the effectiveness of our approach in handling complex transformations while maintaining the integrity of the original image features. Whereas the current DDPM-based method, DDPM-PA (third row), seems to underfit the target domain images, resulting in a significant difference in color and style between the generated images and the target images. Our method preserves many shapes and outlines while learning more about the target style. As demonstrated in Figure 1, our method, ANT, maintains more details such as buildings (above), human faces (below) and other intricate elements in the generated images. Moreover, ANT-generated images exhibit a color style closer to the target domain, especially compared to DDPMPA.

Notably, the result for LSUN Church Landscape drawings improved from 0.706 (DDPM-PA) to 0.723 (DDPM-ANT).

Our proposed method accelerates training, achieves faster convergence, and produces images that fit the target style while resembling the source images. Experimental results on few-shot image generation tasks demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-ofthe-art GAN-based and DDPM-based methods, delivering superior image quality and diversity.
