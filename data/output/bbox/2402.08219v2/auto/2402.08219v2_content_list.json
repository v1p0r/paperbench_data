Due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings, and even output probabilities, existing fine-tuning adaptation methods are inapplicable. Consequently, adapting these black-box LLMs is only possible through their API services, raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce BBOX-ADAPTER, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box LLMs. BBOX-ADAPTER distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which incorporates realtime positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback, coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBOX-ADAPTER’s effectiveness and cost efficiency. It improves model performance by up to $6 . 7 7 \\%$ across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference costs by $3 1 . 3 0 \\mathrm { x }$ and $1 . 8 4 \\mathbf { x }$ , respectively.

However, employing fine-tuning APIs for LLM adaptation has several critical issues: (1) Transparency: Aside from a restricted set of adjustable hyperparameters (e.g., the number of tuning epochs), the fine-tuning process remains largely opaque. Crucial aspects, such as the extent of trainable layers and specific model weights, are often undisclosed, hindering optimal customization. (2) Privacy: Uploading training data via APIs introduces potential risks of privacy breaches, limiting the use of LLMs in sensitive domains. For instance, electronic health records containing confidential healthcare information require stringent privacy measures. (3) Cost: The cost associated with fine-tuning APIs is considerably higher compared to inference, making the adaptation expensive.

To fully leverage the capabilities of LLMs in language comprehension and enhance their performance, many users still need to customize them for specific tasks and domains (Chung et al., 2022). A straightforward approach to achieve this involves finetuning (Wei et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b) or continuous pre-training (Ke et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2023) the LM on domain-specific data. However, these methods require extensive computational resources and memory, which becomes increasingly challenging as model sizes grow exponentially. To mitigate the computational and memory burdens for LLM fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods (Hu et al., 2021; Houlsby et al., 2019; He et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021) have been proposed that focus on training only a small subset of parameters rather than the entire model. Examples of such techniques include adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019), prefix tuning (Liu et al., 2022; Li & Liang, 2021), and low-rank adaptation (Hu et al., 2021).

One line of research assumes that only the gradient information is unavailable, while the high-dimensional input and output sequences are accessible. For example, LMaaS (Sun et al., 2022) trains a small, derivative-free optimizer for discrete prompt tuning to enhance the probabilities of ground-truth tokens from the target domain. Another line of research assumes that only output token probabilities from black-box LLMs are available. kNN-Adapter (Huang et al., 2023) augments a black-box LLM with k-nearest neighbor retrieval from an external, domain-specific datastore. It adaptively interpolates LM outputs with retrieval results from the target domain. CombLM (Ormazabal et al., 2023) employs fine-tuning on a smaller white-box model to align the output token probabilities of a black-box LLM with the target distribution. Similarly, proxy-tuning (Liu et al., 2024) fine-tunes a smaller LM as an ‘expert’ while its untuned version serves as an ‘anti-expert’. The method involves adjusting the black-box LLM outputs by adding the logit offsets from their tokenlevel predictions for adaptation. CaMeLS (Hu et al., 2023) meta-trains a compact, autoregressive model to dynamically adjust the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning. However, these methods are inapplicable to the latest state-of-the-art black-box LLMs, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and PaLM2 (Anil et al., 2023), due to the inaccessibility of token probabilities.

We first frame the black-box LLM adaptation process as a sampling problem from an EBM (Section 3.1). Following this EBM perspective, we derive a ranking-based NCE loss for adapter updates (Section 3.2), enabling the distinction between source and target domain data. We then describe the process of combining outputs from the black-box LLM and the adapter for adapted inference (Section 3.3). To model the real distributions of both source and target domains, we introduce BBOX-ADAPTER as an online adaptation framework that iteratively samples from the previously adapted inferences and updates the adapters accordingly (Section 3.4).

To address this, we employ NCE (Gutmann & Hyvarinen¨ , 2010; Ma & Collins, 2018; Oord et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2020) as an efficient estimator for $g _ { \\boldsymbol { \\theta } } \\left( \\mathbf { x } \\right)$ . Our approach extends beyond the conventional NCE, which only categorizes samples as either ‘real’ or ‘noise’. Instead, we employ a ranking-based NCE loss that prioritizes ranking true data samples higher than noise (Ma & Collins, 2018). We denote the posterior $q ( k | \\{ \\mathbf { x } _ { k } \\} _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } )$ to be $q ( x _ { k }$ is positive $| \\{ x _ { k } \\} _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } )$ . Specifically, this denotes the probability that the $k$ -th sample is drawn from the ground-truth dataset. Here $[ x _ { k }$ is positive] is the indicator of $x _ { k }$ being the positive sample. Similarly, we apply the simplified notation on $p _ { \\theta } ( k | \\{ \\mathbf { x } _ { k } \\} _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } )$ . Assuming the auxiliary label differentiates between a positive sample from data and a negative one from the LLM, we consider the samples {xk}Kk=1 to estimate the posterior of the label distribution: ",

It substantially reduces the privacy risks inherent in the transmission of confidential data to external APIs. BBOX-ADAPTER also stands out by eliminating the need for access to internal model weights or output probabilities, unlike existing white-box and greybox adaptation methods. Fundamentally, BBOX-ADAPTER can be interpreted as a natural way for adapting black-box LLMs to domain-specific tasks with transparency, privacyconsciousness, and cost-effectiveness.

Additionally, there is the conceivable risk that the gradient information from our proposed adapter, along with the logits bias inherent in black-box LLMs, could be exploited to orchestrate attacks or facilitate ’jailbreaking’ in a manner akin to that described in prior works.

For the GPT series after GPT-3, there are typically two ways to obtain the output token probabilities from black-box LLM API services: (1) logprobs 3 is a parameter in the OpenAI Chat Completions API. When logprobs is set to TRUE, it returns the log probabilities of each output token. However, the API limits the output to the top-5 most likely tokens at each position and their log probabilities, which is insufficient for modeling the entire probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. (2) echo probabilities is a deprecated parameter in Completion API function of gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct. If this parameter is set to TRUE, the API will include the original prompt at the beginning of its response and return the token probabilities. Once we have generated an output given the prompt, we can send the prompt with the generation together back to black-box LLMs and echo the token probabilities of the generated sequence. However, this feature has been deprecated since October 5th, 2023. Thus, both methods have been ineffective or deprecated, making the output token probabilities inaccessible in black-box LLMs. ",

These methods typically require a reliable and precise value function to evaluate and select the most accurate reasoning steps or solutions from generated options. Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a) leverages the frequency of occurrence across multiple sampled reasoning paths to determine a final answer through majority voting. Self-evaluation (Kadavath et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2023) employs a scoring function that directly prompts LLMs to generate verbalized evaluations corresponding to their reasoning. Verification (Li et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a) takes a question and a candidate reasoning path as inputs and outputs a binary signal or a likelihood estimate indicating the correctness of the reasoning path.

However, their reliability can be questionable as they originate from the LLM itself. To address this, PATHFINDER (Golovneva et al., 2023) utilizes a normalized product of token probabilities as its scoring function and maintains the top-K candidate reasoning paths during the tree search process. Toolchain\\* (Zhuang et al., 2023) maintains a long-term memory of past successful reasoning paths and computes a heuristic score accordingly to regularize the LLM scores. Math-Shepherd (Wang et al., 2023b) uses verifications of correctness as binary outcome reward and process reward to train a reward model and reinforces the LLMs accordingly. GRACE (Khalifa et al., 2023) trains a discriminator by simulating the typical errors a generator might make, then employs this discriminator to rank answers during beam search. ",

According to the recommended setting in the original paper (Hu et al., 2021), we set the $\\alpha$ as twice of $r$ , $\\alpha = 2 r$ . The other hyperparameters are listed in Table 8. ",

Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan’s bird feeder feed weekly? A: Let’s think step by step. The squirrel steals 1/2 cup of birdseed every week, so the birds eat $2 ~ - ~ 1 / 2 ~ = ~ 1 ~ 1 / 2$ cups of birdseed. Each cup feeds 14 birds, so Ivan’s bird feeder feeds $1 4 { \\bf \\nabla } \\star { \\bf \\nabla } 1 { \\bf \\nabla } 1 / 2 = 2 1 $ birds weekly. #### The answer is 21 Q: Samuel took 30 minutes to finish his homework while Sarah took 1.3 hours to finish it. How many minutes faster did Samuel finish his homework than Sarah? A: Let’s think step by step. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then 1.3 hours is equal to $1 . 3 \\ \\times \\ 6 0 \\ = \\ 7 8$ minutes. Thus, Samuel is 78 $\\qquad 3 0 \\ = \\ 4 8$ minutes faster than Sarah. #### The answer is 48 Q: Julia bought 3 packs of red balls, 10 packs of yellow balls, and 8 packs of green balls. There were 19 balls in each package. How many balls did Julie buy in all? A: Let’s think step by step. The total number of packages is $3 + 1 0 + 8 = 2 1$ . Julia bought $2 1 \\ \\times \\ 1 9 \\ = \\ 3 9 9$ balls. #### The answer is 399 Q: Lexi wants to run a total of three and one-fourth miles. One lap on a particular outdoor track measures a quarter of a mile around. How many complete laps must she run? A: Let’s think step by step. There are $3 / \\quad 1 / 4 \\ = \\ 1 2$ one-fourth miles in 3 miles. So, Lexi will have to run 12 (from 3 miles) $^ + 1$ (from 1/4 mile) $=$ 13 complete laps. #### The answer is 13 Q: <QUESTION> A: Let’s think step by step. ",
