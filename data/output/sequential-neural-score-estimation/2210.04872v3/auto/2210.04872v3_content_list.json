Our method, inspired by the remarkable success of score-based methods in generative modelling, leverages conditional score-based diffusion models to generate samples from the posterior distribution of interest. The model is trained using an objective function which directly estimates the score of the posterior. We embed the model into a sequential training procedure, which guides simulations using the current approximation of the posterior at the observation of interest, thereby reducing the simulation cost. We also introduce several alternative sequential approaches, and discuss their relative merits. We then validate our method, as well as its amortised, non-sequential, variant on several numerical examples, demonstrating comparable or superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods such as Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE).

        "text": "We begin by outlining some generic features of the sequential procedure, which hold irrespective of the specific sequential method employed (see Sections $3 . 1 \\textrm { - } 3 . 2 )$ . In all cases, the sequential procedure will take place over $R$ rounds, indexed by $r \\geq 1$ . Given a total budget of $N$ simulations, we assume the simulations are evenly distributed across rounds: $N _ { r } = N / R = M$ for $r = 1 , \\ldots , R$ where $N _ { r }$ is the number of simulations in round $r$ . In the first round, we follow the standard NPSE algorithm (Section 2). In particular, we first generate $\\{ \\theta _ { 0 , i } ^ { 1 } \\} _ { i = 1 } ^ { M } \\sim p ( \\theta )$ from the prior, and $\\{ x _ { i } ^ { 1 } \\} _ { i = 1 } ^ { M } \\sim p ( x | \\theta _ { 0 , i } )$ using the simulator. These samples are used to train a score network $s _ { \\psi } ( \\theta _ { t } , x , t ) \\approx \\nabla _ { \\theta } \\log p _ { t } ( \\theta _ { t } | x )$ by minimising (7). By substituting this into (3), we can generate samples approximately from the target posterior. Following the initial round, there are several conceivable sequential procedures one could use to generate samples from $p ( \\theta | x _ { \\mathrm { o b s } } )$ . We now describe several such methods. Broadly speaking, these procedures differ in (i) how they define the proposal prior; and (ii) how they correct for the mismatch between the proposal posterior and the true posterior. ",

This approach is known as SNPE. Such methods circumvent the bias introduced by the use of a proposal prior in various ways, including a post-hoc importance weight correction (SNPE-A) (Papamakarios & Murray, 2016), minimising an importance weighted loss function (SNPE-B) (Lueckmann et al., 2017), and re-parametrising the proposal posterior objective (SNPE-C) (Greenberg et al., 2019). Alternatively, the use of a truncated prior as the proposal circumvents the need for a correction (TNPSE) (Deistler et al., 2022a).

Early examples of this approach assume that the likelihood can be parameterised as a single Gaussian (Wood, 2010), or a mixture of Gaussians (Fan et al., 2013). More recent approaches, referred to as SNLE, train conditional neural density estimators, over a number of rounds (Lueckmann et al., 2019; Papamakarios et al., 2019).

        "text": "In some sense, this comparison between TSNPE and TSNPSE reflects a wider discussion regarding the tradeoffs between (discrete) normalising flows and CNFs. The former are associated with a lower computational cost, while the latter are much more flexible, which can result in more accurate inference (e.g., Grathwohl et al., 2019; Finlay et al., 2020). As such, preference for a method based on a discrete normalising flow (e.g., TSNPE) or a CNF (e.g., TSNPSE) will depend on the problem at hand. For example, for challenging real-world simulators, the additional cost incurred by a CNF may be negligible in comparison to the cost of acquiring simulations. ",

Our results, including the percentage of valid summary statistics versus the number of simulations, and a posterior predictive sample, are provided in Figure 4. We also provide a pairwise marginal plot of our final posterior approximation in Figure 7 (Appendix E.2). In the final round, we achieved $81 \\%$ valid summary statistics from the simulator (Figure 4c), superior to the percentage achieved by other methods for the same simulation budget. We also note that the obtained posterior produces samples which closely match the observed data (Figure 4a). In addition, the posterior marginals (Figure 7) are very similar to others previously reported in the literature (Deistler et al., 2022a; Glockler et al., 2022). ",

First, with the exception of SNPSE-C, the sequential methods in this paper can also be applied to other methods based on CNFs. In this sense, a natural extension of our work would be to develop a sequential variant of FMPE (Dax et al., 2023). Second, in this paper we used a relatively simple neural network architecture, with a relatively small number of parameters, in large part to demonstrate the robustness of our approach. In contrast, the architectures used by diffusion models in other modalities are often highly specialised, and have received significant attention in their own right (e.g., Karras et al., 2022). Undoubtedly, further investigation into effective network design for SBI problems would be a fruitful direction for future work. ",

In particular, TSNPSE requires computing $\\mathrm { H P R } _ { \\varepsilon }$ of the approximate posterior to define the proposal, which involves computing the approximate posterior density over many samples. In TSNPE, which uses a normalising flow, this is relatively inexpensive as a single forward pass is required for sampling, and a single backward pass for density evaluation (Dinh et al., 2017; Papamakarios et al., 2017). In contrast, with TSNPSE, which uses a CNF, multiple forward passes are required for sampling, ",

There are various approaches to two-sample DRE, amongst others, moment matching (Gretton et al., 2009), probabilistic classification (Qin, 1998; Cheng & Chu, 2004; Bickel et al., 2007), and ratio matching (Sugiyama et al., 2008; Kanamori et al., 2009; Tsuboi et al., 2009; Yamada & Sugiyama, 2009). In our case, not only do we have access to samples from the prior, but we can also evaluate the density.

Meanwhile, Figure 8 shows the expected coverage of the approximate posterior, computed according to the simulation-based coverage calibration (SBCC) procedure described in Deistler et al. (2022a). This plot indicates that, for mid-low confidence levels, the empirical expected coverage is smaller than the confidence level (i.e., the posterior is overconfident). Importantly, however, the empirical expected coverage approximately matches the confidence level for high confidence levels. We expect that, as suggested in Hermans et al.
