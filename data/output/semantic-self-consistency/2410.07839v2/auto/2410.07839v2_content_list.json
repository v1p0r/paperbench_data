        "text": "While large language models (LLMs) have rapidly improved their performance on a broad number of tasks, they still often fall short on reasoning tasks. As LLMs become more integrated in diverse real-world tasks, advancing their reasoning capabilities is crucial to their effectiveness in nuanced, complex problems. Wang et al. [33]’s self-consistency framework reveals that sampling multiple rationales before taking a majority vote reliably improves model performance across various closed-answer reasoning tasks. Standard methods based on this framework aggregate the final decisions of these rationales but fail to utilize the semantic information detailed in the step-by-step reasoning paths. Our work introduces semantic self-consistency, enhancing this approach by incorporating and analyzing both the reasoning paths of these rationales in addition to their final decisions before taking a majority vote. These methods not only improve the reliability of reasoning paths but also cause more robust performance on complex reasoning tasks. ",

Despite these achievements, models still perform suboptimally in domains such as mathematics, commonsense, and complex algorithmic reasoning [10]. Various methods such as chain-of-thought prompting have been developed to further increase reasoning capabilities and was further enhanced by the introduction of self-consistency, which demonstrate that baselines can be pushed forward by sampling and ensembling multiple model responses with chain-of-thought to improve prediction quality [34, 23].

To achieve this, we use semantic vector embeddings in combination with self-consistency to group consistent model outputs, aiding in the identification of similar responses to estimate the most likely output. Additionally, we introduce a semantic filtering mechanism that discards degenerate or hallucinated outputs, which can be utilized for analyzing smaller sample sizes. Overall, we demonstrate that self-consistency with semantic marginalization not only improves accuracy across a range of benchmarks but also serves as a filtering mechanism. By introducing these methods, we aim to provide a framework for improving performance and analyzing the semantic usage of model outputs in reasoning. ",

The process of clustering based on semantic vectors can be challenging due to the nuanced and abstract nature of reasoning processes. This limitation underscores the need for advanced featurization models and explicit choice of a fitting fine-tuned model [22]. Like showcased in Table 6, multiple models should be considered for semantic analysis, to ensure that the model outputs are grouped in a way that truly reflects their underlying meaning and relevance. Without these fitting featurizers, on fields with more subtle variations or on short sequences, the employed method might not be able to distinguish different sequences well enough to uphold a notable positive effect.
