In Figure 2, we show that PPO performance saturates after a certain batch size despite the ceiling being higher. This is due to the issue in data sampling mechanisms. In particular, at each timestep actions are sampled from a Gaussian with some mean and variance. This implies that most sampled actions are near the mean and with large number of environments, many environments are executing the same actions leading to duplicated data. This implies that the performance of PPO saturates at some point as we increase the number of environments. ",

This allows us to use the PPO’s clipped surrogate objective, maintaining the stability benefits of PPO while latching onto high reward trajectories even though they are off-policy. A schematic of our approach, termed SAPG, is shown in Figure 1.

When training in simulation, this speed-up can be achieved by distributing experience collection or different parts of training across multiple processes.[22, 21, 6, 12] However, through the introduction of GPU-based simulators such as IsaacGym [17], the capacity of simulation has increased by two to three orders of magnitude. Due to this, instead of focusing on how to parallelize parts of the algorithm, the focus has shifted to finding ways to efficiently utilize the large amount of simulation data. Previous works such as [1, 2, 8, 25, 10] use data from GPU-based simulation to learn policies in complex manipulation and locomotion settings. However, most of these works still use reinforcement learning algorithms to learn a single policy, while augmenting training with techniques like teacher-studentbased training and game-based curriculum. We find that using the increased simulation capacity to naively increase the batch size is not the best way to utilize massively parallel simulation. ",

[15] developed a variant of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) called PQL which splits data collection and learning into multiple processes and shows impressive performance on many benchmark tasks. We use PQL as one of our baselines to compare our method to off-policy RL in complex tasks. Although off-policy algorithms are much more data-efficient, they usually get lower asymptotic performance than on-policy policy gradients. This has inspired works to develop techniques to use off-policy data in onpolicy methods. [11] has been one of the major techniques used to realize this.

Since CPU-based simulators typically run only 100s of environments in parallel, conventional wisdom is to simply sample on-policy data from a Gaussian policy in all the environments since as the number of datapoints increases, the Monte Carlo estimate becomes more accurate. However, this intuition no longer holds in the extremely large-scale data setting where we have hundreds of thousands of environments on GPU-accelerated simulators like IsaacGym. IID sampling from a Gaussian policy will lead to most actions lying near the mean, and most environments will execute similar actions, leading to wasted data (fig. 2). ",

Our algorithm trains a variety of $M$ policies $\\pi _ { 1 } , \\ldots , \\pi _ { M }$ instead of having just one policy. However, simply training multiple policies by dividing environments between them is also inefficient. This is equivalent to training an algorithm with different seeds and choosing the best seed. One approach is to add hyperparameter mutation [24] to the policies and choosing the hyperparameters that perform the best among all of them. However, even in this case, all of the data from the “worse” policies goes to waste, and the only information gained is that some combinations of hyperparameters are bad, even though the policies themselves may have discovered high reward trajectories. We need to somehow aggregate data from multiple policies into a single update. We propose to do this via off-policy updates. ",

In particular, the entropy loss is $\\mathcal { H } ( \\pi ( \\boldsymbol { a } \\ | \\ \\boldsymbol { s } ) )$ . The overall loss for the policy $i$ (or the $( i - 1 ) \\mathrm { t h } )$ follower is $L ( \\pi _ { i } ) =$ $L _ { o n } ( \\pi _ { i } ) + \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { e n t } } ( i - 1 ) \\cdot \\mathcal { H } ( \\pi ( a \\mid s ) )$ . The leader doesn’t have any entropy loss. Different scales of coefficients produce policies with different explore-exploit tradeoffs. Followers with large entropy losses tend to explore more actions even if they are suboptimal, while those with small coefficients stay close to optimal trajectories and refine them. This leads to a large data coverage with a good mix of optimal as well as diverse trajectories. We treat $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { e n t } }$ as a hyperparameter. ",

[15] are comparatively easier since they have lower degrees of freedom and the object doesn’t move around much and remains inside the hand. On these tasks, we observe that PQL and PPO are able to make significant progress. In particular, we find that PQL is very sampleefficient because it is off-policy and utilizes past data for updates. However, we find that SAPG achieves higher asymptotic performance. This is because on-policy methods are better at latching onto high reward trajectories and do not have to wait several iterations for the Bellman backup to propagate back to initial states. As discussed previously, in large-scale settings in simulation, we are primarily concerned with asymptotic performance since we want to maximize the downstream performance of our agents (within a reasonable training time budget). We see that on AllegroHand, SAPG beats PQL by a $21 \\%$ margin, while on the ShadowHand task it achieves comparable performance. On these tasks, both PBT and PPO generally perform worse. This is because PPO is not able to efficiently leverage the large batch size. PBT loses the benefit of its hyperparameter mutation because the environment is simpler and the default hyperparameters work well, so it roughly reduces to simple PPO in N environments. ",

These tasks consist of a complex environment but a simple reward function allowing opportunities for emergent strategies to be learnt such as in-hand reorientation under the influence of gravity, reorientation against the table, different types of throws and grasps and so on. The performance of the agent in the above three tasks is measured by the successes metric which is defined as the number of successes in a single episode. Three tasks include: ",
