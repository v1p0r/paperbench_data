        "text": "Visual reprogramming (VR) is a prompting technique that aims to re-purpose a pre-trained model (e.g., a classifier on ImageNet) to target tasks (e.g., medical data prediction) by learning a small-scale pattern added into input images instead of tuning considerable parameters within the model. The location of the pattern within input samples is usually determined by a pre-defined mask shared across all samples. In this paper, we show that the shared mask potentially limits VR’s generalization and increases its approximation error due to the lack of sample-level adaptation. Motivated by this finding, we design a new framework for VR called sample-specific multi-channel masks (SMM). Specifically, SMM employs a lightweight ConvNet and patch-wise interpolation to generate sample-specific three-channel masks instead of a shared and pre-defined mask. Since we generate different masks for individual samples, SMM is theoretically shown to reduce approximation error for the target tasks compared with existing state-of-the-art VR methods. We also empirically demonstrate its performance gain on both ResNet and ViT. The success of SMM further highlights the broader applicability of VR in leveraging the latent knowledge of pre-trained models for various target tasks.

Concretely, VR is a prompting method that fixes a pre-trained model and only alters the input space by adding some learnable patterns (usually some noise) to target images. The location of the patterns to be learned is usually determined by a pre-defined binary mask that is shared across all samples (Elsayed et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2020; Bahng et al., 2022). The key benefit of VR methods is that learning the pattern whose size is around the image size requires much less computing resource than finetuning considerable parameters within the model, posing VR as a promising research area in using pre-trained models (Chen et al., 2023; Tsao et al., 2024).

Since the generated masks should be the same size as the pattern to be learned, when the size of masks is inconsistent with that of the pattern, the patch-wise interpolation module will be utilized to re-scale the generated masks to fit the pattern, facilitating the training process of the mask generator (detailed in Section 3).

The advantage is more pronounced on the datasets where the target domains are more different from the original domain, such as SVHN, Flowers102, and EuroSAT. On SVHN, $6 . 1 \\%$ and $3 . 1 \\%$ improvements have been witnessed for ResNet-18 and ResNet-50, respectively, while over $10 \\%$ improvement is observed on the Flowers102. On DTD, the padding-based method has better results for ResNet-18.

        "text": "As shown in Table 3, SMM consistently stands out as the best performer on all datasets. A key observation is that only keeping shared pattern $\\delta$ reduces VR effectiveness in featurerich datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, Flowers102, and UCF101). Besides, using only $f _ { \\mathrm { m a s k } }$ without $\\delta$ , leads to suboptimal performance on datasets with enough training data per class, including CIFAR10, SVHN, GTSRB, and SUN397. Moreover, the single-channel method is less effective, especially on datasets where images have fewer varying color palettes (e.g., GTSRB and Flowers102). Overall, we find that the shared noise in SMM boosts model performance if sufficient training data is provided, whereas the sample-specific $f _ { \\mathrm { m a s k } }$ enables specificity for classification tasks demanding detailed feature discrimination. Lastly, the multi-channel allows for adjusting to channel-specific priorities. ",

Other features such as flower pistils in passion flowers are also widely present in various similar classes such as ‘oxeye’, ‘daisy’ and ‘orange dahlia’, making the centers of flowers potential sources of interference in classification. Thus, for passion flowers, noise in the center of the flowers is not masked out. When classifying ‘water lily’, SMM will enhance the noise on interfering objects in the image. Similarly, when classifying ‘cyclamen’, similar stems are also commonly found in other classes such as ‘gaura’ and ‘rose’, which hinders accurate classification. Therefore, it is reasonable for SMM to introduce more noise to these interfering components. These results show that SMM is able to retain the important parts of the image and remove the interference. ",

To show the relationship between the sizes of the input images and the output masks, we use $s , p$ , and $k$ to represent the stride, padding, and kernel sizes, respectively, while $H$ and $W$ denote the height and the width of a certain channel. The output dimensions of the output channel after convolution or pooling are $\\begin{array} { r } { \\left\\lfloor { \\frac { H + 2 p - k } { s } } \\right\\rfloor + 1 } \\end{array}$ and $\\left\\lfloor { \\frac { W + 2 p - k } { s } } \\right\\rfloor + 1$ . As shown in Figure 10, when $s = 1 , p = 1 , k = 3$ , the size of a single channel remains unchanged; when $s = 2 , p \\overset { \\_ } { = } 0 , k = 2$ , the size of a channel is reduced by half in each dimension. In other words, by only using $3 \\times 3$ convolution layers, $f _ { \\mathrm { m a s k } } ( . | \\phi )$ can retain the original size of a single channel. However, if we introduce Max-Pooling layers to remove redundant information, the output size will be shrunk and another patch-wise interpolation module should be included in $f _ { \\mathrm { m a s k } } ( . | \\phi )$ for resizing. Assuming that $l$ Max-Pooling layers are used, the output size of a single channel becomes $\\left\\lfloor { \\frac { H } { 2 ^ { l } } } \\right\\rfloor \\times \\left\\lfloor { \\frac { W } { 2 ^ { l } } } \\right\\rfloor$ .

Input VR can also be combined with finetuning-based methods. In this section, we will add the input VR module (i.e, using SMM as an example) to finetuning-based methods and analyze the performance gain. A widely-used method - finetuning the fully connected layer (named ‘Finetuning-FC’) - is employed as the baseline method. Using ResNet-50 as the well-trained model, we add our SMM input VR module to ‘Finetuning-FC’ to demonstrate the effectiveness of our module. ",
