In this work, we present a functional reward encoding (FRE) as a general, scalable solution to this zero-shot $R L$ problem. Our main idea is to learn functional representations of any arbitrary tasks by encoding their state-reward samples using a transformerbased variational auto-encoder. This functional encoding not only enables the pre-training of an agent from a wide diversity of general unsupervised reward functions, but also provides a way to solve any new downstream tasks in a zeroshot manner, given a small number of rewardannotated samples. We empirically show that FRE agents trained on diverse random unsupervised reward functions can generalize to solve novel tasks in a range of simulated robotic benchmarks, often outperforming previous zero-shot RL and offline RL methods.

Household robots are more beneficial the more chores they can complete; self-driving cars the more places they can reach. Building upon this premise, we draw inspiration from the recent success of unsupervised learning in language (Brown et al., 2020) and vision (Kirillov et al., 2023), which has shown that a single generalist model trained on Internet-scale data can immediately solve a wide array of tasks without further training or fine-tuning. Motivated by these successes, we study an analogous way to train a generalist agent from unlabeled offline data such that it can immediately solve new user-specified tasks in a without training. This has been referred to as the zero-shot reinforcement learning $( R L )$ problem (Touati et al., 2022). From this data, the hard challenge is how to discover, without labels, a task representation that is robust to downstream objectives – in essence, bypassing the need for a human to specify wellshaped reward functions before training.

Previous multi-task RL methods typically assume a parameterized family of tasks, specifying tasks by manually designed task parameters (Barreto et al., 2017), symbolic annotations (Andreas et al., 2017), or language embeddings (Silva et al., 2021; Shridhar et al., 2023).

Approaches such as the forward-backward method (Touati & Ollivier, 2021; Touati et al., 2022) extend the SF framework by avoiding the need to train state features separately. However, these SF-based methods share a limitation in that they can only learn value functions in the linear span of state features. In contrast, we do not make any assumptions about the task structure, allowing the policy to learn any reward functions based on our functional reward embedding. We show that this not only makes our policy universal, but also leads to better empirical performance than these SF methods in our experiments. ",
